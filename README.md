# Benchmarking Memory Performance

## Overview

This Benchmark was originally created to investigate performance of DAX enabled file systems in persistent memory. It comes with two engines, mmap, which measures memory throughput, and mmap_lat, which measures mmap latencies.

## Installation
<!-- more to come -->

```shell
make
```

## Usage

Information about each engine and how to use them is in their respective file in the documentation. Results will be shown in a file called "results.out", as well as stdout.
